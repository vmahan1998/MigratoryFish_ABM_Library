# Complex Model Building Tutorial: One-Way Migration

### Module Integration

-   Brief explanation of how functions (e.g., staging, schooling) interact.
-   Clarify temporal structure (e.g., tick-based sequence) and spatial scale.
-   Describe coupling logic

### Function Dependencies

-   What variables are required as inputs for each function?

-   What functions must be called before/after? (e.g., must calculate stress before checking staging triggers)

-   Dependency table showing variable flow between submodels.
