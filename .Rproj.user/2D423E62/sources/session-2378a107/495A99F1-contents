# Model Building Tutorial: Staging & Schooling

### Module Integration

-   Brief explanation of how functions (e.g., staging, schooling) interact.
-   Clarify temporal structure (e.g., tick-based sequence) and spatial scale.
-   Describe coupling logic

### **Function Dependencies**

-   What variables are required as inputs for each function?

-   What functions must be called before/after? (e.g., must calculate stress before checking staging triggers)

-   Dependency table showing variable flow between submodels.

| Function  | Required Inputs       | Output Variables           | Dependent On     |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| `staging` | `E_agent`, `I_stress` | `E_agent`, `patch records` | `osmoregulation` |
| schooling |                       |                            |                  |
