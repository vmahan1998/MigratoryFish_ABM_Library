# Overview

## Background

Diadromous fish species such as river herring, striped bass, and sturgeon navigate coastal and estuarine systems that are increasingly affected by human activity, climate change, and legacy contaminants. Modeling their movement and behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales requires tools that can integrate physiological stressors, environmental variability, and behavior-based decision-making.

Agent-based models are among the most powerful tools available for ecological forecasting and fisheries management, but they are also among the most complex. Their structure and computational demands can make them difficult to apply in practical management settings. Many biologists and ecologists who hold deep, species-specific expertise often have limited training in advanced programming or systems modeling. This is partly due to gaps in secondary and post-secondary education, where exposure to high-level mathematics and coding is often minimal, despite the fact that many ecological processes are governed by nonlinear systems and feedbacks.

As a result, traditional approaches to modeling marine and diadromous fish frequently oversimplify or exclude key biological functions such as osmoregulation, thermoregulation, schooling behavior, and contaminant exposure. Many existing models also lack standardized representations of these behaviors, limiting the interpretability of results and reducing their usefulness for applied management. This function library was developed to address these limitations by offering modular, empirically grounded components designed for use in agent-based models. Each function is clearly documented and can be applied independently, allowing for transparent testing, modification, and reuse across a wide range of ecological modeling scenarios.

## Introduction to Agent-Based Models

provide basics of ABM

## Structure

Each chapter in this library corresponds to a major behavior or physiological function relevant to migratory fish, including:

-   **Osmoregulation**

-   **Bioaccumulation of contaminants**

-   **Thermoregulation**

-   **Directional migration (landward and seaward)**

-   **Schooling and Staging**

-   **Selective Tidal Stream Transport**

-   **Homing behavior**

-   **Foraging**

-   **Predator-prey interactions**

-   **Spawning**

The final chapter provides guidance on how to integrate multiple functions into a complete agent-based model, demonstrating how these components work together to simulate fish behavior in dynamic coastal and estuarine systems.

Within each chapter, each function or behavior is documented using the ODD protocol (Grimm et al., 2006; 2010; 2020). The ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol is a standardized framework for describing agent-based models. It promotes transparency in model development and ensures consistency across implementations, especially when integrating multiple behavioral or ecological functions.

-   **Overview** provides the purpose of the model component, identifies the entities involved (e.g., fish agents, environmental patches), and outlines the general processes.

-   **Design** concepts describe the key theoretical underpinnings such as emergence, adaptation, objectives, sensing, stochasticity, and interaction.

-   **Details** specify initialization steps, input data requirements, and the rules or submodels that govern behavior.

By following the ODD protocol, this library ensures that each function is self-contained, interpretable, and ready for adaptation to a wide range of species, sites, or management scenarios.

## Application Context

This library was originally developed in support of research on the influence of tidal behavior and contaminant exposure on anadromous fish in the Penobscot River Estuary. However, its modular design allows for application to other estuarine and coastal systems where fish respond to gradients in salinity, temperature, velocity, and pollutants.

## How to Use This Library

Each function or behavior in this library can be combined with others to build a complete agent-based model for migratory fish. These functions are designed to be modular, adaptable, and easily configured for different species, life stages, or site-specific conditions.
